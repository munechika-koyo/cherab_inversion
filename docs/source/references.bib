  abstract  = "This chapter reviews multichannel broadband measurement of the
               soft-X-ray radiation and total radiation in magnetically
               confined fusion plasma experiments. Common detector types used
               (including bolometers), details of their application, and
               interpretation of their measurements are described. An
               introduction is given to the application of computed tomography
               methods in the mathematical reconstruction of emission profiles
               from multiple (approximately) line-integral measurements, taking
               into account the specific circumstances common in magnetically
               confined fusion plasma experiments. Although the emphasis is on
               two-dimensional tomography of poloidal cross sections, the
               applications of Abel inversion, three-dimensional tomography,
               vector tomography, and other specific methods are briefly
               discussed. Several examples of the application and the plasma
               parameters that can be derived are given.",

  abstract = "The soft X-ray (SXR) emission provides valuable insight into
              processes happening inside of high-temperature plasmas. A
              standard method for deriving the local emissivity profiles of the
              plasma from the line-of-sight integrals measured by pinhole
              cameras is the tomographic inversion. Such an inversion is
              challenging due to its ill-conditioned nature and because the
              reconstructed profiles depend not only on the quality of the
              measurements but also on the inversion algorithm used. This paper
              provides a detailed description of several tomography algorithms,
              which solve the inversion problem of Tikhonov regularization with
              linear computational complexity in the number of basis functions.
              The feasibility of combining these methods with the minimum
              Fisher information regularization is demonstrated, and various
              statistical methods for the optimal choice of the regularization
              parameter are investigated with emphasis on their reliability and
              robustness. Finally, the accuracy and the capability of the
              methods are demonstrated by reconstructions of experimental SXR
              profiles, featuring poloidal asymmetric impurity distributions as
              measured at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.",
