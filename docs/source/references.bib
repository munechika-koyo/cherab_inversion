  abstract  = "This chapter reviews multichannel broadband measurement of the
               soft-X-ray radiation and total radiation in magnetically
               confined fusion plasma experiments. Common detector types used
               (including bolometers), details of their application, and
               interpretation of their measurements are described. An
               introduction is given to the application of computed tomography
               methods in the mathematical reconstruction of emission profiles
               from multiple (approximately) line-integral measurements, taking
               into account the specific circumstances common in magnetically
               confined fusion plasma experiments. Although the emphasis is on
               two-dimensional tomography of poloidal cross sections, the
               applications of Abel inversion, three-dimensional tomography,
               vector tomography, and other specific methods are briefly
               discussed. Several examples of the application and the plasma
               parameters that can be derived are given.",
