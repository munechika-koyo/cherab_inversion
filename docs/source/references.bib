               confined fusion plasma experiments. Common detector types used
               (including bolometers), details of their application, and
               interpretation of their measurements are described. An
               introduction is given to the application of computed tomography
               methods in the mathematical reconstruction of emission profiles
               from multiple (approximately) line-integral measurements, taking
               into account the specific circumstances common in magnetically
               confined fusion plasma experiments. Although the emphasis is on
               two-dimensional tomography of poloidal cross sections, the
               applications of Abel inversion, three-dimensional tomography,
               vector tomography, and other specific methods are briefly
               discussed. Several examples of the application and the plasma

  abstract = "The L-curve is a log-log plot of the norm of a regularized
              solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm. It
              is a convenient graphical tool for displaying the trade-off
              between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the
              given data, as the regularization parameter varies. The L-curve
              thus gives insight into the regularizing properties of the
              underlying regularization method, and it is an aid in choosing an
              appropriate regularization parameter for the given data. In this
              chapter we summarize the main properties of the L-curve, and
              demonstrate by examples its usefulness and its limitations both
              as an analysis tool and as a method for choosing the
              regularization parameter. 1 Introduction Practically all
              regularization methods for computing stable solutions to inverse
              problems involve a trade-off between the ``size'' of the
              regularized solution and the quality of the fit that it provides
              to the given data. What distinguishes the various regularization

  author   = "Xiang, Hua and Zou, Jun",
  abstract = "In this paper, we propose an algorithm for solving the
              large-scale discrete ill-conditioned linear problems arising from
              the discretization of linear or nonlinear inverse problems. The
              algorithm combines some existing regularization techniques and
              regularization parameter choice rules with a randomized singular
              value decomposition (SVD), so that only much smaller scale
              systems are needed to solve, instead of the original large-scale
              regularized system. The algorithm can directly apply to some
              existing regularization methods, such as the Tikhonov and
              truncated SVD methods, with some popular regularization parameter
              choice rules such as the L-curve, GCV function, quasi-optimality
              and discrepancy principle. The error of the approximate
              regularized solution is analyzed and the efficiency of the method
              is well demonstrated by the numerical examples. \copyright{} 2013

  abstract = "The soft X-ray (SXR) emission provides valuable insight into
              processes happening inside of high-temperature plasmas. A
              standard method for deriving the local emissivity profiles of the
              plasma from the line-of-sight integrals measured by pinhole
              cameras is the tomographic inversion. Such an inversion is
              challenging due to its ill-conditioned nature and because the
              reconstructed profiles depend not only on the quality of the
              measurements but also on the inversion algorithm used. This paper
              provides a detailed description of several tomography algorithms,
              which solve the inversion problem of Tikhonov regularization with
              linear computational complexity in the number of basis functions.
              The feasibility of combining these methods with the minimum
              Fisher information regularization is demonstrated, and various
              statistical methods for the optimal choice of the regularization
              parameter are investigated with emphasis on their reliability and
              robustness. Finally, the accuracy and the capability of the
              methods are demonstrated by reconstructions of experimental SXR

  abstract = "When discrete ill-posed problems are analyzed and solved by
              various numerical regularization techniques, a very convenient
              way to display information about the regularized solution is to
              plot the norm or seminorm of the solution versus the norm of the
              residual vector. In particular, the graph associated with
              Tikhonov regularization plays a central role. The main purpose of
              this paper is to advocate the use of this graph in the numerical
              treatment of discrete ill-posed problems. The graph is
              characterized quantitatively, and several important relations
              between regularized solutions and the graph are derived. It is
              also demonstrated that several methods choosing for the
              regularization parameter are related to locating a characteristic
              L-shaped ``corner'' of the graph",
